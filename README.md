## Installation & Deployment 📦
- Clone the repository and modify the content of <b>index.html</b> according to your requirement.
- Add or remove images from `varadbhogayata.github.io/assets/img/` directory as per your requirement.
- I highly recommend to use [Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to deploy the website the EASIEST WAY.
- To deploy your website, first you need to create github repository with name `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give any other name.
- Push the generated code to the `master` branch of this repository.
- <b>NOTE:</b> Make sure to set `analyticsId` from your Google Analytics account inside the Google Analytics script tag, if you want to use your own Google Analytics account.

## Recent Projects Feature 🚀

This portfolio includes a dynamic "Recent Projects" section that showcases the latest projects with the following features:

### Features:
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Displays only the latest project initially
- **Load More Functionality**: Button to load additional projects (2 at a time)
- **Responsive Design**: Projects are displayed in a responsive grid layout
- **Interactive Cards**: Each project card includes:
  - Project image
  - Title and description
  - Expandable details with tools used
  - Links to live demo and GitHub repository
  - Material Design animations

### Technical Implementation:
- **JavaScript Array**: Projects are stored in a JavaScript array for easy management
- **DOM Manipulation**: Uses vanilla JavaScript to dynamically generate HTML content
- **Materialize Integration**: Leverages Materialize CSS framework for styling and animations
- **Event Handling**: Implements click events for the "Load More" button

### How it Works:
1. On page load, only the first (latest) project is displayed
2. Users can click "Load More Projects" to reveal additional projects
3. Projects are loaded in batches of 2 for optimal user experience
4. The "Load More" button disappears when all projects are displayed

## Tools Used 🛠️
* [<b>GitHub Pages</b>](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) - To host my static website (HTML, CSS, JS).
* [<b>Materialize</b>](https://materializecss.com/) - A CSS framework to get Google's Material Design components.
* [<b>Typed.js</b>](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) - JavaScript Library
